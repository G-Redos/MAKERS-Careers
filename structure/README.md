# GUIDE TO CAREERS SUPPORT

Hello Maker and soon to be Maker Graduate üëã

We can't wait to meet you and work with you on the job-hunt which in its own way is another growth journey all of its own. Strap in! We know it can be a challenging time and for that reason there's lots of staff ready to support you. The time and energy you'll put into it is worth it and in a year you'll look back and be incredibly proud that you've taken this leap. We also know that you probably won't believe this career change is possible until you receive that offer.

Here's a breakdown of the support we provide and the ways you can connect with us. You're unique individuals and we try to adapt what we do for each of you. Please don't hesitate to ask for what you need if you can't find it here. 

The week after you graduate we run a whole week of workshops designed to teach you the skills you need to find your first tech job.

If you miss a workshop  then you can join a careers bootcamp we run in the future. It's always in the calendar üìÖ

## DAILY RETRO AT 5 PM

We meet every weekday at 5 PM for 30 minutes to retro our day. Anyone can join so you will encounter those who are at different places in their job-hunt which allows for cross-cohort learning.


## ONGOING WORKSHOPS

Our technical and job-hunting workshops are under construction at the moment as we create new content. There is recorded content you can watch in two slack channels which will be new to you. We'll let you know about new workshops there, too. You're not missing out on workshops btw, the existing ones are now all in the Careers Bootcamp.

## CV SUPPORT AND ONE JOB WEDNESDAY

We're well aware that you might really dislike writing or talking about yourself. Maybe you think you've got nothing to write about or that your professional history doesn't quite make sense. We're really keen to help you with this and here are the ways you can tap into our support.

#### Send your CV to your journey success coach for a written review
If you'd like a second person to read your CV, check for errors and offer suggestions to improve its impact, send your Github CV and/or PDF CV to your journey success coach for written feedback.

#### Book a session with your journey success coach for a one to one to discuss you careers history and CV
If you'd prefer to speak to a coach about your CV rather than receive written feedback or you just want to talk through your previous experience to help you understand what's most relevant to a tech employer, then you can can book a one to one session with your journey success coach. We'll cover how to do that next.

#### One Job Wednesday

Every Wednesday you can submit a cover letter and a CV to a technical coach and they will give you feedback within 24 hours! This is really awesome if you want to send out an application but you're not quite sure whether you've hit the brief.

Join jh‚Äìappliers in slack to take part.

## Journey Succcess Coaching

You'll have your own career coach who you can book a one to one with during your job-hunt. In your final week of the bootcamp or perhaps just after you'll receive an email with an invitation to join your coach for a 'Getting To Know You' session. The purpose of this is for your coach to understand your individual experience of Makers, what kind of job you're looking for next and whether you have any additional support needs. It's a great chance for you to debrief and ask any questions you have about what comes next. Sessions are 30 - 45 minutes and you can ask your coach to check your CV then, too.

Once you've had this first session,  you can book follow up sessions using this link: https://airtable.com/shrDGiJyf1AHy9WpE

We have a policy of six coaching sessions per Maker so you can book up to six. Your coach might suggest you book more if you are dealing with an issue where we feel you would benefit from a little more support.

Finally, you'll have access to your journey success coach for the first six months of your job-hunt only. If you are still job-hunting after this then you'll move to a group coaching format with others who have been looking for work for more than six months.

## Interview Coaching: Interview Alerts

If you have an interview coming up then you can ask for individual support from a technical coach. As soon as you know when your interview is, fill out this form and a tech coach will get in touch with you. We call them Interview Alerts.

Interview Alert Form: https://airtable.com/shreXIbreEkZk117P

It doesn't matter what kind of interview it is whether it's an initial chat with HR or to talk about a tech test you've completed. A tech coach will help you prepare for tech and non-tech questions you might be ask.

We can't help you write a tech test but if you're giving a technical test to complete and you have no idea where to start, you can book an interview alert so I coach can help you with what you need to learn or think about before you begin.

## Careers Channel

You have your own channel on slack. We call this your careers channel. It will include you and all of the members of staff here to suppport you. It's also where we'll let you know whether you've been shortlisted for jobs you've applied for and if so, what the interview process will be. If you have any questions at all, you can ask them here. 

One request, please include an @channel or direct the message to the person you want to answer the question (@becks for example) which really helps us streamline our responses.

We do respond to direct messages as well but please don't ask different members of staff the same question. It gets really confusing for us and creates more work. 

## Jobhunting channel

You'll also receive access to this very exlusive channel where we advertise new opportunities coming up. Employer talks are also include in the job-hunting channel we mention above but here's the link again:
