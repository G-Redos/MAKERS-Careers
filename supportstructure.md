# GUIDE TO CAREERS SUPPORT

## The Week After Graduation: CAREERS BOOTCAMP

Hello Maker and soon to be Makers Graduates üëã

We can't wait to meet you and work with you on the other side of the bootcamp for the job-hunt which in its own way is another growth journey all of its own. We know it can be a challenging time for all of you and there's lots of staff ready to work with you as you take the job-hunting journey. We know that the time and energy you'll put into it is worth it and in a year you'll look back and be so proud that you've taken this leap.

Here's a breakdown of the support we provide and the ways you can connect with us. We know you're each individuals and we try to adapt what we do for each of you as we get to know you so you might work with us differently than the way we lay out for you here. This is just our starting point.

The week after you graduate we run a whole week of workshops designed to teach you the skills you need to find your first tech job.
We've learned that if you're able to launch your job-hunt as soon as you graduate and dedicate time and energy to it as if it is your full-time job, you'll get hired faster and you'll enjoy the journey that little bit more.

All the workshops and zoom links are displayed in the [Job Hunting calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y19zZ2dvcW9kZ2Vhdm5qZ2VjZGVhbzNkY2ZmMEBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t).

If you miss a workshop all the week then you can join the same workshop when we run it for a future cohort.

## DAILY RETRO DAILY AT 5 PM

We meet every day at 5 PM for 30 minutes to retro our day. Anyone can join so you will encounter those who are at different places in their job-hunt which allows for lots of cross-cohort learning.


## ONGOING WORKSHOPS

Our technical and job-hunting workshops are under construction at the moment as we create new content. There is recorded content you can watch in two slack channels which will be new to you. We'll probably let you know about new workshops there, too. You're not missing out on workshops, the existing ones are now all in the Careers Bootcamp.

## CV SUPPORT AND ONE JOB WEDNESDAY

We're well aware that you might really dislike writing or talking about yourself. Maybe you think you've got nothing to write about or that your professional history doesn't quite make sense. We're really keen to help you with this and here are the ways you can tap into our support.

#### Send your CV to your journey success coach for a written review
If you'd like a second person to read your CV and check for errors and to offer suggestions on how to improve the impact of your CVs, send your Github CV and/or PDF CV to your journey success coaching and you'll get some written feedback.

#### Book a session with your journey success coach for a one to one to discuss you careers history and CV
If you'd prefer to speak to a coach about your CV rather than receive written feedback or you just want to talk through your previous experience to help you understand what's most relevant to a tech employer, then you can can book a one to one session with your journey success coach. We'll cover how to do that next.


## Journey Succcess Coaching

You'll have your own career coach who you can book a one to one with during your job-hunt. In your final week of the bootcamp or perhaps just after you'll receive an email with an invitation to join your coach for a 'Getting To Know You' session. The purpose of this is for your coach to understand your individual experience of Makers, what kind of job you're looking for next and whether you have any additional support needs. It's a great chance for you to debrief and ask any questions you have about what comes next. Sessions are 30 - 45 minutes to begin with and if there is time you can ask your coach to check your CV, too.

Once you've had this first session,  you can book follow up sessions using this link: https://airtable.com/shrDGiJyf1AHy9WpE

We have a policy of six coaching sessions per Maker so you can book up to six. Your coach might suggest you book more if you are dealing with an issue where we feel you would benefit from a little more support.

Finally, you'll have access to your journey success coach for the first six months of your job-hunt only. If you are still job-hunting after this then you'll move to a group coaching format with others who have been looking for work for more than six months.

## Interview Coaching: Interview Alerts

If you have an interview coming up then you can ask for individual support from a technical coach. As soon as you know when your interview is, fill out this form and a tech coach will get in touch with you. We call them Interview Alerts.

Interview Alert Form: https://airtable.com/shreXIbreEkZk117P

It doesn't matter what kind of interview it is whether it's an initial chat with HR or to talk about a tech test you've completed. A tech coach will help you prepare for tech and non-tech questions you might be ask.

We can't help you write a tech test but if you're giving a technical test to complete and you have no idea where to start, you can book an interview alert so I coach can help you with what you need to learn or think about before you begin.
