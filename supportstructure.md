# GUIDE TO CAREERS SUPPORT

## The Week After Graduation: CAREERS BOOTCAMP

Hello Maker and soon to be Makers Graduates üëã

We can't wait to meet you and work with you on the other side of the bootcamp for the job-hunt which in its own way is another growth journey all of its own. We know it can be a challenging time for all of you and there's lots of staff ready to work with you as you take the job-hunting journey. We know that the time and energy you'll put into it is worth it and in a year you'll look back and be so proud that you've taken this leap.

Here's a breakdown of the support we provide and the ways you can connect with us. We know you're each individuals and we try to adapt what we do for each of you as we get to know you so you might work with us differently than the way we lay out for you here. This is just our starting point.

The week after you graduate we run a whole week of workshops designed to teach you the skills you need to find your first tech job.
We've learned that if you're able to launch your job-hunt as soon as you graduate and dedicate time and energy to it as if it is your full-time job, you'll get hired faster and you'll enjoy the journey that little bit more.

## DAILY RETRO DAILY AT 5 PM

We meet every day at 5 PM for 30 minutes to retro our day. Anyone can join so you will encounter those who are at different places in their job-hunt which allows for lots of cross-cohort learning.
